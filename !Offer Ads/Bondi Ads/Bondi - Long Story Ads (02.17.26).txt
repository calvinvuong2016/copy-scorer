AD 1 — THE DOCTOR LAUGHED
--------------------------

My doctor said weight gain after 40 is completely "normal".

I wasn't going to accept that.

I had been cooking at home for months.

Logging every meal, no wine, no cheat days, no excuses.

But every night when I stepped on the scale, the numbers didn't move.

So I made an appointment and asked her to run some labs.

Something had to be off.

But everything came back normal.

When I told her I was hungry all the time...

That I could eat a full meal and be starving again within the hour...

She smiled at her clipboard.

"Welcome to your 40s," she said.

"Eat a little less and move a little more."

I was ALREADY barely eating. Already at the gym six days a week.

There was no "less" left in me.

And she was sitting there telling me to try harder.

I didn't say any of that.

I just thanked her and walked out to my car.

And then I sat there for probably twenty minutes, staring at the parking lot, feeling completely stupid for thinking she was going to have an actual answer.

Because it wasn't like I hadn't tried.

I had done keto for two months and gained back more than I lost.

I had done real fasting, the kind where you're shaking by mid-morning and you keep going anyway because you think that's what discipline looks like.

I had tracked every meal for weeks.

And every single time the weight came back, the voice in my head said the same thing.

You're the problem.

Something is wrong with you.

Other women can do this. Why can't you?

I had gotten so deep into believing that, I stopped going to the gym altogether.

Just quietly stopped showing up one week and never went back.

What was the point?

That's where I was when my friend Dana texted me.

She's a dietitian who works specifically with women going through perimenopause.

She said she'd been sitting on something she wanted to send me.

She'd been hesitating because she didn't know if I was in a place to receive it.

Honestly? I wasn't.

But I was also out of ideas, so I looked.

It was about a woman named Erica Lugo.

Maybe you know her from The Biggest Loser (America's most popular celebrity fitness coach).

She went from 322 pounds down to 160.

And it was because of one thing she discovered that nobody had ever told her about.

Something that had nothing to do with willpower or aging.

Once she addressed it, everything changed.

I tried what she found.

I wasn't hopeful. I want to be clear about that.

I had burned through too many false starts to get hopeful about anything.

But a few weeks in, something was different.

The hunger that had been running my life just... quieted down.

I could eat a meal and feel satisfied. Actually satisfied, not "I'll manage" satisfied.

The 2pm crash stopped.

The 9pm cravings stopped.

I stopped waking up at night thinking about food, which I didn't even realize I'd been doing until it stopped.

One morning I reached for a pair of jeans I hadn't worn in over a year.

Didn't even think about it. Just grabbed them.

They zipped.

I stood in my closet for a second just looking at myself.

My husband walked past the open door, stopped, looked back at me, eyes scanning from head to toe.

We went out to dinner the following weekend.

Just us.

Stayed longer than we planned.

The last time we'd done that felt like a different lifetime.

I texted Dana that night, and told her everything.

I've shared what she sent me with four other women since then, and two of them reached back out within weeks.

If you've ever sat in your car after a doctor's appointment feeling completely alone in what's happening to your body...

If you've done every right thing and still can't slim down…

Please don't let the voice in your head win this one.

You are not broken. You just haven't been told the truth yet.

God Bless ♥️

AD 2 — THE WEIGHT CAME BACK
-----------------------------

Nobody tells you why the weight comes back.

I found out the hard way.

It took 18 months. Not 18 months of halfhearted effort.

18 months of no birthday cake, including my own.

No wine.

Tracking every meal through two Thanksgivings and a family vacation where everyone else ordered off the menu and I ate what was on my plan and told myself it was fine.

It was not fine.

But I did it.

And I remember the exact feeling of stepping on that scale the morning the last of it was gone.

I actually cried. Happy cried, which I almost never do.

I thought I'd figured something out that most people couldn't.

Then, a few months later, the scale ticked up.

Three pounds. I told myself it was water weight, hormones, the long weekend.

Then five.

Then eight.

I went harder at the gym.

Cut out the wine I'd let back in.

Cut out bread again, cut out most of what had made life feel normal.

It kept climbing.

By the time I'd gained back most of what I lost, I wasn't sad anymore.

I was past sad.

I was just done with the whole thing.

One morning I drove to the gym, sat in the parking lot, and looked at the building for a long minute.

And drove home.

I sat in my kitchen and ate a bowl of cereal.

Not because I was hungry.

Just because I was done pretending any of it worked.

I stayed home from the gym for weeks after that.

Weeks turned into a couple of months.

I stopped talking about losing weight, stopped thinking about it, filed it under "things I tried and failed at" and tried to move on.

And that's when my sister-in-law Kelli called.

She'd been through something similar a couple years before, and she said she had something she thought I should see.

I told her I'd look at it. (I had no intention of looking at it.)

But she texted the next day to follow up, and the day after that.

Until finally she just said: "It's not a diet. I promise. Just look at this woman's story."

Fine. I looked.

The woman was Erica Lugo.

Professional trainer. The Biggest Loser.

She went from 322 pounds down to 160.

And she said it came down to one thing the weight loss world had completely missed.

Something biological. Something that had nothing to do with effort.

Once she addressed it, the weight stopped coming back.

I tried what she found.

Somewhere between skeptical and just wanting to see what would happen.

A few weeks in, the hunger changed.

That constant background noise, the thing where you're full but already thinking about the next meal, just got quieter.

Then one morning my pants were loose.

I noticed but didn't say anything, didn't want to jinx it.

They were loose the next morning too.

And slowly, without me really tracking it, I started getting dressed without that familiar dread.

The heaviness of it was just gone.

My daughter asked me to come to her friend's graduation party.

In the past I would have found an excuse. Too many people. Too many cameras.

I went.

Got in every single photo.

I texted Kelli afterward.

She laughed and said she knew I'd be the last one to admit she was right.

She was right.

I've passed what she sent me on to four other women since then.

Two of them texted me back within the month.

If you've done the work, made the sacrifices, and still can't keep the weight off…

If you've sat in a parking lot and just driven home because you couldn't face starting over one more time...

Don't give up before you see what Erica found.

Click below to see her full story and how you can finally lose the weight and actually keep it off this time.

You've been fighting harder than you needed to. There was a reason it kept coming back.

God Bless ♥️

AD 3 — SHE CAUGHT HIM LOOKING
--------------------------------

I caught my husband STARING at another woman at dinner...

(We've been married 20 years.)

It was our anniversary dinner. The nice place, the dress I'd been saving, the whole thing.

And I watched his eyes follow a woman across the room for just a second.

He didn't think I saw.

Before you say anything... I know he loves me. I know it meant nothing.

But I sat across from him for the next two hours, smiling at the right moments, laughing when I was supposed to.

The whole time I was thinking: he looked at her the way he used to look at me.

Because I knew what I'd been doing to us.

For two years I had been turning the lights off before bed, every single night.

Saying "I'm too tired" when I wasn't.

Timing it so I was already under the covers before he came upstairs.

He'd stopped reaching for me months ago.

And honestly, I'd made it easy for him to stop.

He married someone who used to walk into a room like she owned it.

I don't know when she left. But she'd been gone for a long time.

I used to be the one grabbing the camera at every party.

Now I was the one texting "can you not post that" before they even hit share.

I'd tried to fix it so many times.

Lost weight and gained it back, tried a different approach, lost it again.

Until starting over started to feel like a joke I kept falling for anyway.

On the drive home that night, something just went quiet in me.

It wasn't anger. It was more like... I'm done being the woman who disappears.

I just didn't know yet what "done" was supposed to look like.

A few days later, my coworker Renee brought it up at lunch.

Renee had lost a lot of weight the year before and I'd never actually asked her how.

She just brought it up one day, like she'd been waiting for the right moment.

She said, "There's this woman you need to hear about."

"She was a trainer on The Biggest Loser. Lost 160 pounds. And she figured out why most women can never keep it off, no matter how hard they try."

I said, "That's depressing."

Renee said, "Keep going."

So I kept going.

Erica found out there was a real biological reason for what was happening, something that had nothing to do with effort.

Once she fixed it, everything changed.

I wasn't sold. But I was out of ideas and I was tired of hiding from my own life.

So I tried what she found.

A few weeks in, the hunger that had been running my life just... softened.

The cravings I'd been white-knuckling through every night stopped being a battle.

I noticed my jeans weren't tight anymore.

Didn't say anything. Didn't want to jinx it.

One morning I got dressed without turning the lamp off first.

Didn't even realize I'd done it until I was halfway out the door.

My husband reached for my hand in a parking lot a few weeks later.

Just grabbed it, like it was the most natural thing. Like we used to.

We stayed up past midnight one night, just the two of us, talking the way we used to.

I'd forgotten how much I missed that.

Last month at dinner with friends, I wore a red dress.

It had been in my closet for three years with the tags still on.

My husband looked at me across the table and smiled the way he used to smile.

That was enough.

I told Renee she was right and I should have listened sooner.

She laughed and said that's what she always says.

I've passed this on to two other women at work who've been in the same place.

Both have since checked in.

If you've ever felt your husband's eyes go somewhere else and felt something just... go quiet inside you...

If you've been hiding yourself because you hate what you see in the mirror...

Please see what Erica found.

You deserve to stop fighting something you didn't cause.

AD 4 — THE ANNIVERSARY TRIP
-----------------------------

I wore a bikini on our anniversary trip, and I HATED it.

My husband planned the whole thing. Twenty years together, a beach resort, the kind of trip you tell yourself you've earned.

So I went along with it. Even bought a new swimsuit, told myself the whole flight down I was finally going to be brave about this.

I was not brave about it.

The first morning we went down to the pool, I sat on the edge of a lounge chair with a towel across my lap, pretending to read.

Mentally doing the math on myself against every other woman who walked by.

And then my husband's eyes went to a woman walking past. Just for a second. He didn't even realize he did it.

I'm not saying he did something wrong. I know he loves me.

But I was standing there in a swimsuit for the first time in four years, already feeling like a stranger in my own skin, and that one second just broke something open.

I said I had a headache and went back to the room.

I sat on the edge of the hotel bed and I didn't cry. I was past crying.

I just sat there going back through every time I'd tried. The keto phase. The personal trainer I paid for three months and quietly stopped showing up to. Every diet I'd believed in, every pound that had eventually come back.

Every time I told myself: I am the problem.

I had believed that for years. And sitting on that hotel bed, I finally just got tired of believing it.

It wasn't some big dramatic realization. More like I just ran out of room for that story.

I needed an actual answer for why my body kept fighting me, not another version of advice I'd already failed at.

When we got home, I started looking.

A few days later my friend Michelle texted me, almost like she'd picked up on something. She used to be a personal trainer before she had kids, spent years studying all of this.

She said, "I've been meaning to send you something for weeks. I'm sending it now."

I almost told her I wasn't in the mood. I was so tired of being sent things.

But she said, "Just look at the woman's name. Then tell me you don't want to read the rest."

The woman's name was Erica Lugo. The Biggest Loser. 322 pounds down to 160.

And she said it happened because of one thing she found that no diet or workout plan had ever touched.

Once she understood it, she stopped feeling at war with herself.

I tried what she found. Didn't expect much.

A few weeks in, the 2pm crash I'd had every single day for years just... stopped. The late-night cravings stopped too.

I started waking up without that heavy, foggy feeling I'd been carrying so long I'd honestly forgotten it wasn't normal.

One morning I pulled on a pair of shorts I hadn't worn since the previous summer. They fit the way they used to fit.

I stood in the closet for a minute, not really knowing what to do with that feeling.

A few weeks after that, some friends invited us to their backyard pool, and I went. Didn't spend the whole afternoon wrapped in a cover-up.

My husband kept finding reasons to come stand next to me.

At one point he leaned over and said something quietly. I'm not going to repeat it. But it was the kind of thing he used to say when we were first together.

I called Michelle that night. She said, "I TOLD you."

Three other women in our neighborhood have since started. Two of them have already reached back out.

If you've been covering up at the pool because you hate being seen in your own skin...

If you've been starting over with the same approach and getting the same ending...

Please don't go home from your next trip feeling what I felt on that hotel bed.

You've been working too hard to keep coming up empty.

God Bless ♥️

AD 5 — THE SEXLESS MARRIAGE
-----------------------------

My husband and I haven't had sex in almost three years.

I want to say that out loud because I think too many women are sitting with this completely alone, and...

Nobody ever actually says it.

It didn't happen all at once. It never does.

It started with the lights. I started turning them off before he could see me, then getting dressed in the bathroom, then timing it so I was already in bed before he came upstairs.

He was patient. He never pushed.

And slowly, he stopped reaching for me at all.

I told myself he was just being respectful. Giving me space.

But late at night, when I couldn't sleep, the real thought would creep in.

What if he stopped because he's disgusted?

What if he looks at me now and just... doesn't want me anymore?

I never asked. I was too afraid of what he might not say.

I told myself that was a relief, and on the surface it was, because at least it meant I didn't have to keep finding ways to say no.

But I knew the difference between relief and grief. And what I was sitting with wasn't relief.

For two years the weight had been coming back no matter what I did. I was eating less than I ever had, going to the gym three times a week, and my body just kept gaining like none of it meant anything.

And because I felt so out of control in my own body, I kept pulling back from anything that required me to actually be seen.

Not just in bed. Everywhere.

I stopped showing up in photos, stopped suggesting we go out. I was still there, still in the marriage, but I'd gone quiet in a way I think we both felt and neither of us knew how to name.

And one night, lying in the dark after he'd fallen asleep, I had a thought I couldn't shake.

"This is what you're choosing. Every single night, you choose this."

It had taken me two years to hear that clearly. But once I heard it, I couldn't un-hear it.

I didn't want to keep choosing it, but I also knew willpower wasn't going to fix this. I'd been running on willpower for two years and nothing had changed.

I needed to understand what was actually happening in my body. Not another meal plan. A real answer.

That's how I found Lisa again.

We went to college together and hadn't talked in years, so when she messaged me out of nowhere one afternoon like no time had passed at all, I actually picked up.

We caught up for a while, and at the end she said, "I have to send you something. Promise me you'll actually look at it."

I almost said yes just to be polite and end the call.

But something about her reaching out after all that time, specifically now, felt like it meant something. So I promised.

She sent me the story of a woman named Erica Lugo. Professional trainer. The Biggest Loser. Went from 322 pounds down to 160.

And she said it was because of one biological thing she found that nobody had ever told her about, something that had nothing to do with how hard you're trying.

Once she fixed it, she felt like herself again.

I tried what she found. Didn't tell my husband, didn't want to make it a thing if nothing happened.

A few weeks in, the hunger that had been following me everywhere just quieted down. The cravings I used to battle every night stopped being a battle.

I started having energy after dinner and actually staying in the room instead of finding reasons to disappear early. One night I just stayed up. We watched something on the couch together, and I fell asleep leaning against him.

I hadn't done that in years.

A few weeks later, one evening I came to bed while he was still awake.

Three years of nothing... and I don't even know how to describe what happened next.

It was like someone had turned the clock back fifteen years.

I cried after. Not sad crying.

We didn't sleep much that night. Or the night after that.

He's been looking at me differently ever since, the way he used to look at me when we first got together, like he couldn't believe I was actually his.

I did not expect that part. I thought we'd find our way back slowly.

We did not find our way back slowly.

I texted Lisa that week. She said she knew, said she'd been waiting for me to figure it out.

I've since shared this with two other women who are living exactly what I was living.

You know who you are. The lights-off women. The ones who say they're tired every night because it's easier than explaining.

If you've been shutting your husband out because you're ashamed of what you see in the mirror...

If you've been slowly disappearing from your marriage because you can't stand to be seen...

Please see what Erica found.

Click below to see her full story and how you can finally feel like yourself again, in your body and in your marriage.

You didn't lose yourself. You just haven't found out yet why your body's been stuck.

God Bless ♥️
