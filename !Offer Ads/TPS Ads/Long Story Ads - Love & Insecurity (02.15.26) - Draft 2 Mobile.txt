AD 1: "THE HAND ON HER BACK"
================================================================

My husband put his hand on another woman's back last Saturday night.

Before you think what you're thinking... no. He wasn't having an affair.

It was worse.

We were at a dinner party. Walking through the front door.

He was holding it open for this younger woman -- maybe 30, gorgeous, one of those effortless types.

And as she walked through, his hand went right to the small of her back.

That guiding touch.

The one he used to give me.

Every door we walked through for 23 years, his hand was right there. Low on my back. Restaurants. Church. Even the grocery store on a Tuesday.

It was his thing.

This quiet way of saying "you're mine and I'm proud of it."

I didn't notice when it stopped.

But I noticed when he did it to her.

He caught himself too. Pulled his hand away fast, like he'd touched a hot stove.

She didn't notice. She was already inside, laughing about something.

But I saw it.

And it hit me so hard I had to grab the door frame.

That night I lay in bed running through every restaurant, every parking lot, every front door from the last year...

And I couldn't find one single time his hand was there.

Not one.

I rolled over and stared at the wall and thought... when did I become someone he doesn't reach for anymore?

I didn't bring it up. Because what would I even say? "Why don't you touch my back anymore?" That sounds crazy.

But it wasn't about the door.

It was about the fact that somewhere along the way, I stopped being the woman he wanted to pull close in a room full of people.

I could feel it in everything else too.

The way he'd hand me my coffee without looking up. The way he'd say "night" instead of "goodnight, babe."

Little things that added up to this awful feeling I couldn't shake -- that I was disappearing right in front of him.

I started avoiding mirrors. I couldn't look at my own face without seeing what he saw.

The lines around my mouth that got deeper every year. The skin under my chin that didn't used to be there.

I hated it.

And I hated that I hated it. Because I'm 53 and I know I'm not supposed to care this much.

But I did. It was keeping me up at night.

Then my friend Diane sent me an article.

She said "read this, it helped me more than anything."

It was a report from a doctor who ranked the top 5 skincare brands for women our age. The affordable ones -- not the $200 a jar stuff.

I almost didn't click. I'd tried everything. Retinol. Vitamin C serums from Target.

Two different night creams that promised the world and didn't deliver a thing.

But something about the way this doctor explained WHY most of what we buy doesn't work pulled me in.

And the brand he ranked #1 wasn't anything I'd heard of.

I ordered it that week.

After about two weeks, my skin started to feel different. Smoother. Like it had some life in it again.

By week three I could see it in the mirror -- and that was something, because I'd been avoiding that mirror for months.

My jawline looked tighter. The lines around my mouth were softer. My skin had a warmth to it I hadn't seen in years.

Then one night we were leaving for dinner.

He held the door open for me.

And his hand went right to the small of my back.

He didn't think about it. I could tell. It was muscle memory kicking back in.

I didn't say a word. I walked through that door with his hand on my back and smiled the whole way to the car.

If you've felt what I felt -- like you're fading and nobody sees it but you -- do yourself a favor and read the article Diane sent me.

It's the one that changed everything.

AD 2: "READY TO GO?"
================================================================

My husband hasn't looked at me -- I mean LOOKED at me -- in over a year.

He used to, though.

For 20 years, every time I came down the stairs dressed up for a night out, he'd stop what he was doing.

Sometimes he'd whistle. Other times he'd do that stupid fake-stumble thing like I knocked him off his feet.

Cheesy and over the top. And I loved every second of it.

I don't know the exact night it stopped.

But I remember the night I noticed.

We were going to his company Christmas party. I spent over an hour getting ready.

New dress. Did my hair. Spent an extra twenty minutes on my makeup because I wanted to feel like THAT version of myself.

I came down the stairs and he was standing by the door. Keys in one hand, phone in the other.

He didn't look up.

"Ready to go?"

Two words. Said to the phone, not to me.

I stood on the bottom step for a second. Waiting. Thinking maybe he'd glance up and catch himself.

He didn't.

He opened the front door and walked to the car.

On the drive over, I caught my reflection in the passenger window. And I thought... oh. That's why.

Because the woman in that dark glass didn't look like someone worth stopping for anymore.

The lines around her eyes. The softness in her jaw where things used to be tight. She looked tired. And old.

I couldn't even be mad at him. Because when I looked in that window, I understood.

I stopped looking forward to going out after that.

I'd take longer to get ready -- not because I was doing more, but because I kept second-guessing everything.

Changing outfits. Wiping off my makeup and starting over. Pulling at the skin under my chin.

Trying to find the woman he used to whistle at.

Then my friend Vicky forwarded me an article. She said her sister sent it to her and couldn't stop raving about it.

It was a doctor's report ranking the top 5 skincare brands for women our age. Not the expensive department store stuff.

The ones that work and don't cost half your paycheck.

I almost scrolled past it. I'd wasted enough money already on serums and creams that promised everything and delivered nothing.

But I read the whole thing. And the way this doctor broke down why most products fail -- it clicked.

Like... no wonder nothing had been working.

The #1 brand he ranked wasn't one I'd heard of. But I figured what's one more try at this point.

I ordered it.

About three weeks in, I was brushing my teeth and stopped mid-brush.

Because something was different. My skin had a brightness to it I hadn't seen in years.

The lines around my eyes were softer. My jawline looked firmer. More like it used to.

I started wearing less makeup. I started looking in the mirror without that knot in my stomach.

Then last Friday we were heading out to dinner.

I came down the stairs.

And he looked up from his phone.

He paused. Set the keys on the counter. And said something I hadn't heard in so long I almost didn't know how to handle it.

"Hold on. Come here. Let me look at you."

I stood at the bottom of those stairs and my eyes started burning. I had to blink hard so he wouldn't notice.

He didn't whistle. He didn't do the stumble thing.

He did something better.

He walked over to me and said "you look amazing."

And he meant it. I could tell from his eyes. He was looking at me the way he used to look at me.

If your husband has stopped looking... if "ready to go?" is all you hear now... read the article my friend sent me.

It's a short report on the top 5 skincare brands that are helping women over 45 turn back the clock -- without spending a fortune.

It brought him back to the bottom of those stairs.

AD 3: "HIS SIDE OF THE BED"
================================================================

I reached for my husband in bed last night.

He didn't reach back.

And I need to say this first because I know how it sounds -- this wasn't about sex.

It was about his hand. His arm draped over my hip. His foot pressed against mine under the covers.

That thing he used to do where he'd roll over half-asleep and pull me in close, mumbling something I could never hear, his face buried in my hair.

I lived for those moments.

I don't know when they stopped. But there's a gap in our bed now that could swallow me whole.

He sleeps on his side, facing the wall.

I sleep on mine, facing the ceiling.

Some nights I feel like I could disappear from that bed and he wouldn't notice until morning.

Last Tuesday I decided to test it.

I waited until he was settled. Breathing slow. Almost out.

I slid across and put my hand on his back. Gentle. The way you touch someone you love and miss even though they're right there.

Nothing.

He didn't move. Didn't roll over. Didn't make a sound.

I pulled my hand back and rolled to my side of the bed.

And I lay there in the dark feeling more alone than I've felt in my entire life.

Not alone in a sad-movie kind of way.

Alone in the married-for-27-years, lying-six-inches-apart, and-he-doesn't-even-know kind of way.

Because being alone by yourself is one thing.

Being alone next to the person you love... that's a whole different kind of hurt.

I started wondering if it was me. If whatever made him reach for me had burned out without either of us seeing it.

And every time I thought about it I'd end up standing in front of the bathroom mirror.

Pulling at the skin under my eyes. Tracing the creases in my neck with my finger.

Wondering... is this why? Is this what made him stop?

A couple weeks later I was on the phone with my older sister and she could hear it in my voice.

She didn't ask what was wrong. She texted me a link afterward and said "try this before you do anything drastic."

It was an article -- a doctor's report ranking the top 5 skincare brands for women our age.

Not the ones from commercials. The ones backed by research that don't cost a mortgage payment.

I wasn't expecting much. I'd been burned too many times.

But the #1 brand on his list caught my attention. I'd never seen it before.

And the science behind it made sense in a way nothing else had.

So I tried it.

Within a few weeks, something started to shift. My skin was smoother. Plumper.

The lines around my eyes looked softer and my face had this warm glow I hadn't seen since my early 40s.

I started feeling like the version of me that he used to pull close.

Then one night -- maybe three weeks in -- I woke up around midnight.

And his arm was around me.

He'd pulled me in. Tight. Face buried in my hair. Sound asleep.

Doing the thing he used to do before everything went cold between us.

I didn't move.

I didn't breathe.

I held onto his arm like I was afraid he'd let go. Tears rolling sideways down my temples and soaking into the pillow.

He didn't let go.

If there's a gap in your bed that shouldn't be there... if you've been reaching for someone who doesn't reach back... read this article.

It's a doctor's ranking of the top 5 skincare brands that are firming up skin and fading wrinkles for women over 45.

For a fraction of what you'd expect.

It gave me back something I thought I'd lost for good.

================================================================
AD 4: "HE STOPPED DANCING WITH HER"
================================================================

I watched my husband slow dance with another woman last Saturday.

And nobody at that party thought anything of it... except me.

Let me back up.

For years, my husband had this thing he did.

I'd be at the stove cooking dinner and he'd come up behind me, wrap his arms around my waist, and start swaying.

No music playing. He'd hum something off-key right against my neck.

I'd swat him with a spatula sometimes.

Other times I'd lean back into him and we'd stay there rocking while whatever was on the stove started to burn.

That was ours. Nobody else got that.

I don't know when it stopped.

But one night I was stirring sauce and realized I'd been standing at that stove alone for months.

He was in the living room. In his recliner. Waiting for me to call him to the table like I ran a restaurant.

I told myself it was nothing. He's tired. His back hurts. We're both older now.

Then we went to Jim and Pat's retirement party.

And that's where SHE was.

The neighbor. Two doors down. You know the type.

She's the one who's always a little too close to everyone's husband. Who touches his arm every time she talks to him.

Who laughs at everything he says like he's doing stand-up comedy -- those big, loud, head-thrown-back laughs where her hand lands right on his shoulder.

I've watched her do it for years. And every time, I've bitten my tongue hard enough to taste metal.

So a slow song comes on.

And this woman -- bold as brass -- walks right up to my husband, grabs his hand, and says "oh come on, it's one dance!"

And he went.

He put his hand on her waist. He started swaying. And he was smiling. That warm, easy smile I used to get in the kitchen.

She had on this fitted dress. Her skin looked incredible -- smooth, glowing, like aging hadn't touched her once.

And there was my husband, swaying with her the way he used to sway with me.

Right in front of me.

I sat at that table and watched a woman who didn't earn a single second of that dance get the thing I'd been missing for months.

She didn't spend 25 years standing beside him at that stove.

She didn't raise his kids or hold his hand in hospital waiting rooms.

She showed up looking good in a tight dress and took what was mine.

And he didn't even glance over to see if I was watching.

I didn't say a word the entire drive home. He didn't notice.

That night I stood in the bathroom and looked at myself for a long time.

My jaw had gotten soft. The lines around my mouth were deeper than I remembered. My neck... I won't even go there.

I cried until my face was swollen.

The next morning I called my friend Lisa because I needed someone to talk to before I said something to him I couldn't take back.

Lisa listened. And then she said something that caught me off guard.

"Before you blow up your marriage, read this first."

She sent me an article. A doctor had ranked the top 5 skincare brands for women over 45.

Not the department store stuff -- the ones that work and won't drain your savings account.

I didn't care about skincare in that moment. I cared about my husband dancing with another woman.

But Lisa said "trust me." And I trust Lisa with my life.

The #1 brand on the list was something I'd never heard of. I ordered it that night.

Couple weeks in, I noticed changes. My skin was tighter. Had some brightness to it that wasn't there before.

The lines around my mouth were softening up and my face had life in it again.

By week four, I looked in the mirror and didn't cry.

By week six, I felt like someone worth dancing with again.

And then one evening I was at the stove, stirring pasta, not expecting anything...

And I felt two hands settle on my hips.

He pulled me back into him. Started swaying. No music. His breath warm on my neck.

Off-key humming I hadn't heard in so long it almost broke me.

I closed my eyes and grabbed onto his arms and didn't let go.

The pasta boiled over.

Neither of us cared.

If you've been watching your husband give someone else what used to be yours...

If your reflection is making you feel like you're losing more than a glow... read the article Lisa sent me.

It's a short report on the top 5 skincare brands that are smoothing out wrinkles and firming up skin for women over 45.

Without the crazy prices.

I got my husband back.

I got my kitchen dance back too.

================================================================
AD 5: "HE STOPPED KISSING HER GOODBYE"
================================================================

My husband stopped kissing me goodbye.

I don't think he noticed. But I've been counting. Six months.

For 22 years, every single morning before he left for work, he kissed me.

Sometimes on the lips if I was awake. Other mornings on the forehead while I was still half-asleep.

It didn't matter how rushed he was or if we'd been fighting the night before.

That kiss was automatic. Like grabbing his keys or locking the door behind him.

Then one morning about six months ago, I was lying in bed and heard the garage door rumble open.

And I realized he was already gone.

No kiss.

I told myself he was running late. No big deal.

It happened again the next morning. And the one after that.

Now it's been six months of the same thing and I haven't said a word about it.

Here's what I haven't told anyone.

I still wake up every morning when I hear him moving around the bedroom.

I hear him brush his teeth. Open the closet. Buckle his belt.

And I lay there with my eyes shut. Breathing slow so he'll think I'm asleep.

Waiting.

Every morning I wait for him to lean over. To brush the hair off my face.

To press his lips against my forehead like he did a thousand mornings before.

And every morning I hear the same thing -- his footsteps getting quieter across the carpet. The bedroom door clicking shut.

The garage door.

Then nothing.

I've thought about saying something. A hundred times I've thought about it.

But I can't.

Because what if I bring it up and he looks at me all confused and says "huh... I didn't realize I stopped"?

That would hurt worse than the missing kiss.

Because it would mean I've become so invisible that something he did every morning for two decades disappeared from his mind...

And he didn't even feel the gap.

I think I know why it happened. And I see the evidence every morning after he leaves.

I drag myself to the bathroom mirror and there she is. The woman he doesn't kiss anymore.

Lines under her eyes that weren't there a few years ago. Skin that's gone dull and dry.

The woman he married had a glow about her. This woman in the mirror... doesn't.

I started sleeping in later after that. Because at least if I was asleep for real, I didn't have to lay there and listen to him leave.

Then one morning -- maybe three weeks ago -- I was scrolling Facebook before sunrise.

Because I'd been wide awake since he walked out without kissing me, as usual.

And someone had shared an article.

A doctor ranked the top 5 skincare brands for women over 45. The ones that work. The affordable ones.

I clicked on it because I had nothing to lose and I was so tired of feeling like a ghost in my own house.

The #1 brand was something I'd never come across.

But this doctor explained what goes on inside your skin as you age and why most products don't do a thing about it.

It made more sense than anything I'd gotten from the drugstore aisle.

I ordered it that same morning.

Over the next few weeks I started to see changes. My skin looked smoother. Firmer.

The dark shadows under my eyes weren't as heavy. My face had warmth in it again -- some color, some glow.

I didn't mention it. I wanted to see if he'd notice on his own.

And then last Thursday morning, I was half-asleep.

And I felt his hand brush the hair off my forehead.

Then his lips. Right between my eyes. Slow and soft. Like he meant it.

I kept my eyes closed so he wouldn't see them watering.

And right before he pulled away, he whispered something I hadn't heard in six months.

"Bye, beautiful."

His footsteps crossed the room. The door clicked shut. The garage door opened and closed.

And I smiled into that pillow until my face hurt.

If your husband has stopped reaching for you in the morning...

If you've been lying there waiting for something that doesn't come anymore... read this article.

It's a doctor's ranking of the top 5 skincare brands that are helping women over 45 get their glow back and smooth out fine lines.

Without spending a fortune.

It brought my mornings back.
