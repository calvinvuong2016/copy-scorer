Seniors Born Before 1975 Now Eligible to Get Funeral "Expenses" Covered (here’s how)

Hook:

(Houston, TX) A funeral in 2025 costs more than most people paid for their first car. 

Body:

AND their second car. Combined.

Two vehicles that got you to work, raised your kids, lasted decades versus one afternoon service. 

And somehow funeral homes convinced everyone that this price-tag makes perfect sense.

But there's a new program designed for seniors that offers full funeral coverage for $25/month. 

Problem is, most people will never hear about it. 

It’s only offered in eligible states, and even then, most still don’t qualify. 

But if you do, you can lock in this rate for life. No rate increases, ever.
