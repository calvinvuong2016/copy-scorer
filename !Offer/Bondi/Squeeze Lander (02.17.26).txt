(Los Angeles, CA) You’d think a trainer on The Biggest Loser was always “fit”. Wrong. 

Body Copy:

America’s most popular Biggest Loser Coach, Erica Lugo weighed a shocking 322 pounds.

Three and a half years ago, she was standing in her kitchen writing a very "dark" letter to her husband and kids.

Not because she was sick or dying… but because her own mind had become a prison she couldn’t escape.

🔴 "One morning I woke up and it was just like I wasn't myself anymore."

🔴 "And then the intrusive thoughts started, which scared the crap out of me."

🔴 "I was more afraid of living the next 20 years like this than dying."

🔴 "I don't want to live anymore."

It was in her darkest hour that made her realize that she needed to change.

And that's when she discovered something that completely changed everything. 

Erica discovered three hidden Hunger “Switches” to reduce Body-Fat.

They're constantly ON, forcing your body into overdrive and “storing” fat. 

Once Erica figured out how to shut the Hunger "Switches" OFF...

She went from 322 pounds down to 160 pounds in record time. 

And the best part?

All her dark thoughts faded away, and she completely turned her life around.

She even beat the battle against depression and was taken off anti-depressants, for good.

Her incredible story has been seen by millions of people, and even featured on TODAY and People.
