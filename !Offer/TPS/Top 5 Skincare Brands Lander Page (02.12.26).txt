(Los Angeles) As we age, finding the right skincare routine becomes more important than ever. The products you use seriously impact how your skin looks and feels, especially when it comes the most common concerns like wrinkles, sagging, and dark spots. But with so many options available, it can be overwhelming to decide which brands to trust. 

As an anti-aging specialist, I've tested the most popular skincare brands to find the most effective for maintaining healthy, youthful skin.

The #1 brand took me by surprise, but I can see why stores have already started stocking up on inventory for 2026.

5. Cerave
Cerave is well-known for their lotions and other skincare products. However, their products only focus on moisturizing skin, rather than deep, long-lasting hydration of the skin cells.
 

4. Pond's
Pond’s has been around since the mid-1800s and has an extensive wealth of knowledge in the skincare industry. However, the company has been slow to adopt new advances in skincare science and incorporate them into their products. Their product line, while large, is not as advanced or effective as many competitors.
 

3. Neutrogena
Neutrogena is another common brand in the skincare industry. However, in recent years the company has faced criticism because of misleading advertising and potentially dangerous ingredients being used in their products.
 

2. Olay
Olay’s full selection of beauty and skincare products is tough to beat. However, it is often found to be pricey and many people think their skincare solutions involve too many steps and different products.
 

Who Took the #1 Spot?
See why dermatologists consider this the #1 Skincare brand for women over 45; and learn how you can get your hands on the Wrinkle-Reducing formula that eliminates fine lines and saggy skin, faster and more effective than the competition, AND only half the price. (watch this 5 min video)
