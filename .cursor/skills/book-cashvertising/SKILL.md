# Cashvertising (Book) Scoring Bot

Score copy 1–100 using the framework from **Cashvertising** by Drew Eric Whitman. Target: **80**. If score < 80, revise the copy and re-score until it reaches at least 80.

## Core Cashvertising Elements (Scoring Criteria)

**1. Life-Force 8** — Copy taps at least one of the eight core human desires: (1) Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension; (2) Enjoyment of food and drink; (3) Freedom from fear, pain, danger; (4) Sexual companionship; (5) Comfortable living; (6) Superiority, winning, status; (7) Care and protection of loved ones; (8) Social approval. The strongest copy connects the offer to one or two of these clearly.

**2. Headlines** — "60% of people only read headlines." Headline must stop the reader and compel the next sentence. Use proven formulas (e.g. "How to [benefit] without [pain]"). Headline does real work; no throwaway.

**3. Fear Factor (when used)** — If fear is used: (a) scare is significant and specific, (b) copy offers clear recommendations to overcome the threat, (c) the action is perceived as effective and achievable. Fear without solution or with vague solution scores lower.

**4. Sensory language** — Copy uses concrete, sensory language instead of generic adjectives. Reader can see, feel, or imagine the benefit. No vague "amazing" or "incredible" without specifics.

**5. Social proof** — Evidence that mirrors the audience (demographics, situation). Testimonials, numbers, or proof that "people like them" got the result. Not generic celebrity; relatable proof.

**6. Scarcity / urgency** — When used, tied to biological or real urgency (limited time, quantity, or consequence). Not fake scarcity. Ego protection: purchase positioned as smart investment where relevant.

**7. USP / differentiation** — Unique selling proposition or clear reason this product beats alternatives. Outcompete rivals on a specific, believable dimension.

## Scoring Rubric (1–100)

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| 90–100 | Life-Force 8 clearly tapped; headline stops and pulls; fear (if used) has solution; sensory language; strong social proof; scarcity/urgency (if used) credible; clear USP. |
| 80–89 | Strong on most elements; minor gaps in sensory language or proof. |
| 70–79 | Good headline or good desire hook; 2–3 elements weak (e.g. vague language, thin proof). |
| 50–69 | No clear Life-Force 8 link; weak headline; generic language; little proof or differentiation. |
| 0–49 | No desire hook; headline doesn't work; no sensory language; no proof; no USP. |

**Pass threshold: 80.**

## Workflow
