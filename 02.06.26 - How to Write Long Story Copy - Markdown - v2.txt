THE LONG STORY AD PLAYBOOK
What To Do (And What NOT To Do) When Writing Converting Story Ads
THE HOOK (First 1-3 Lines)
✅ DO THIS:
Start with a SPECIFIC moment or statement that creates immediate tension

"My doctor told me to 'just eat less and move more.'"
"I cried in the Macy's dressing room for 20 minutes."
"My husband asked if I was pregnant. I'm 52."
Make it RELATABLE to your avatar's pain

They should read it and think "Holy shit, that's ME"
Create curiosity WITHOUT being clickbaity

We want intrigue, not deception
Use concrete details over vague statements

NOT: "I was unhappy with my body"
YES: "I avoided mirrors in my own bathroom"
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
NEVER mention "an article" or "a video" in the hook

This immediately screams "ad" and kills engagement
NOT: "I read this article about weight loss..."
NOT: "My friend sent me a link..."
Don't start with generic pain points

NOT: "Losing weight is hard"
NOT: "Getting older sucks"
Don't be dramatic for drama's sake

Melodrama = eye rolls
Authenticity = connection
Don't bury the emotional moment

Get to the pain FAST
First line should make them FEEL something
THE SETUP (Building Context)
✅ DO THIS:
Paint the "before" picture with VIVID details

What they were wearing
Where they were sitting
What time of day it was
Who else was there
Show their frustration through actions, not just feelings

NOT: "I felt hopeless"
YES: "I threw out every pair of jeans that didn't fit and cried in the closet"
Stack relatable struggles

Show them you UNDERSTAND their world
"Turkey wraps for lunch while coworkers order pizza"
"Spin classes at 6am three days a week"
"Tracking every bite in MyFitnessPal like it's my second job"
Use the "AND" pattern to maintain momentum

Avoid "but" statements that create resistance
Keep the flow moving FORWARD
Include skepticism if writing for a skeptical avatar

"I've seen every weight loss trend come and go"
"I don't fall for miracle cures"
This makes the eventual transformation MORE believable
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
Don't info-dump about the product/solution yet

We're still in STORY mode
Resist the urge to sell
Don't make them sound pathetic

Struggling = relatable
Victim mentality = turn-off
Don't use cliché language

NOT: "I hit rock bottom"
NOT: "I was at my wit's end"
Use FRESH, specific descriptions
Don't lose the human voice

Write like you're telling a friend
NOT a copywriter trying to sound clever
THE DISCOVERY MOMENT (The Turn)
✅ DO THIS:
Make the discovery feel ORGANIC, not forced

Through a trusted friend/family member
Through personal research
Through a chance conversation
Through frustration leading to exploration
Show initial resistance or skepticism

This makes the story BELIEVABLE
"I almost deleted that text"
"I rolled my eyes so hard"
"I thought 'here we go again'"
Use a PERSON to introduce the solution when possible

Sister, friend, neighbor, coworker
People trust people more than "I found this thing"
Describe WHY they decided to try it despite skepticism

"But Rebecca knows me. She wouldn't send me BS."
"Something in her voice made me actually listen"
"I figured I had nothing left to lose"
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
Don't make them sound gullible

NOT: "I immediately believed it would work"
They need to be relatable, not naive
Don't introduce the solution as "an article" or "a video"

This kills the story flow
It immediately signals "this is an ad"
Don't skip the emotional decision

Show us WHY they chose to try this
What was the tipping point?
Don't rush this part

The turn is CRUCIAL
Give it space to breathe
THE TRANSFORMATION (The Proof)
✅ DO THIS:
Show SPECIFIC changes in their life

What their doctor said
What their husband/friend noticed
What changed about their daily routine
How they felt in their clothes
Use dialogue when possible

"My doctor looked at my chart and said, 'Whatever you're doing is clearly working'"
Dialogue = authenticity
Include MOMENTS, not just outcomes

NOT: "I lost weight"
YES: "I tried on a fitted dress at Nordstrom and it actually looked good"
Make it believable and sustainable

NOT dramatic overnight changes
Gradual, realistic progress
Show emotional wins, not just physical

Confidence returning
Relationships improving
Self-image shifting
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
NEVER include specific timeframes tied to results

NOT: "I lost 30 pounds in 3 months"
NOT: "After just 2 weeks I saw changes"
This violates ad policies
Don't make it sound too easy

If it sounds unrealistic, they won't believe you
Show it was simple, but not magic
Don't oversell

Let the story do the heavy lifting
Resist the urge to add hype
Don't forget the emotional payoff

This isn't about numbers
It's about how they FEEL now
THE SHARING MOMENT (Social Proof)
✅ DO THIS:
Show how they're now helping others

"I've sent this to at least 10 women"
"My sister and I talk about it every week"
"Three teachers at my school are doing it now"
Make it feel natural and generous

They're sharing because they CARE
Not because they're being paid
Include specific relationships

NOT: "I told people about it"
YES: "My department chair. My neighbor. Three teachers at my school."
Show the ripple effect

Others are experiencing similar results
This amplifies credibility
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
Don't make them sound like a salesperson

They should sound like a friend
NOT: "I'm telling everyone about this amazing product"
Don't be vague about who they shared with

Specificity = believability
Don't skip this section

Social proof is POWERFUL
It shows this isn't just a fluke
THE BRIDGE TO CTA (Connecting Reader to Story)
✅ DO THIS:
Directly address the reader's current state

"If you're like me..."
"If you're tired of..."
"If you're feeling alone in this struggle..."
Remind them of the core pain point

Bring it back full circle
"If you're skeptical of all the weight loss hype..."
Make them feel SEEN and UNDERSTOOD

This is where empathy closes the gap
They should feel like you GET them
Create urgency through FOMO, not fake scarcity

"You deserve to finally know what actually works"
"Don't let skepticism keep you stuck like I almost did"
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
Don't abruptly jump to selling

The transition should feel SMOOTH
We've earned the right to make an ask
Don't use cheesy sales language

NOT: "This limited-time offer"
NOT: "Act now before it's too late"
Don't make assumptions about their journey

Meet them where THEY are
Not where you want them to be
THE CTA (Call To Action)
✅ DO THIS:
Focus on ONE solution, not multiple

"Click here to discover the #1 solution that finally worked for me"
NOT: "Check out these 5 solutions"
Make it benefit-driven

What will THEY get from clicking?
NOT: "Click here to read the article"
YES: "Click here to see the #1 solution Japanese women use to stay slim after 45"
Keep it clear and simple

One action
One click
No confusion
Use language that matches the story's tone

If the story is skeptical → CTA should acknowledge that
If the story is emotional → CTA should honor that
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
NEVER mention "article," "video," or "link" in the CTA

This screams "ad" at the worst possible moment
Focus on the BENEFIT, not the format
Don't overcomplicate it

Not multiple CTAs
Not multiple steps
Keep it STUPID simple
Don't be pushy or aggressive

The story did the selling
CTA should feel like a natural next step
Don't promise unrealistic outcomes

Keep it grounded
Keep it believable
OVERALL STORY STRUCTURE PRINCIPLES
✅ DO THIS:
Write in SHORT paragraphs

1-3 sentences MAX per paragraph
White space = readability
Use conversational language

Write like you TALK
NOT like you're writing an essay
Include sensory details

What did it smell like?
What were they wearing?
What time of day was it?
Show, don't tell

NOT: "I was sad"
YES: "I avoided mirrors in my own bathroom"
Use the ellipsis to create rhythm and pause

"And here's the thing..."
"Three months later..."
Creates natural reading flow
Make it HUMAN

Imperfect
Relatable
Real
Test multiple hooks

The hook is 80% of your success
Write 10+ versions
Pick the one that HITS hardest
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
Don't write long, dense paragraphs

People scroll on mobile
Make it EASY to consume
Don't try to sound "professional" or polished

This isn't a corporate memo
It's a STORY
Don't oversell or hype

Let the story do the work
Trust the structure
Don't be vague or generic

Specificity = believability
Details = connection
Don't forget the avatar

Every line should resonate with THEM
Not you
COPY VELOCITY PRINCIPLES (Make It Hit HARDER)
✅ DO THIS:
Stack PAIN quickly in the setup

Multiple relatable struggles
Build empathy FAST
Use CURIOSITY to pull them forward

"And what I read actually made SENSE for the first time in years"
Keep them wondering WHAT the solution is
Layer in PROOF throughout

Doctor's comments
Husband's reaction
Friend's testimonial
Create CONSTRAINTS that eliminate objections

"I didn't have to give up my morning coffee"
"It wasn't some dramatic overhaul"
End with a PROMISE

What will clicking give them?
Make it CLEAR
❌ DON'T DO THIS:
Don't drag out the setup

Get to the emotional hook FAST
They'll bounce if you're boring
Don't forget to use "AND" instead of "BUT"

Maintain forward momentum
Don't create resistance
Don't bury the transformation

This is the PAYOFF
Give it the space it deserves
FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU PUBLISH
✅ Ask Yourself:
 Does the hook create immediate emotional tension?
 Is the avatar's pain VISIBLE in the first 5 lines?
 Does the story feel REAL and relatable?
 Is the discovery moment organic and believable?
 Are there specific details that make this feel authentic?
 Does the transformation show emotional AND tangible changes?
 Is there social proof woven in naturally?
 Does the CTA focus on ONE solution with a clear benefit?
 Did I avoid mentioning "articles" or "videos" in the hook and CTA?
 Does this sound like a HUMAN wrote it, not a marketer?
 Would I believe this story if I read it?
 Does it pass the "friend test" — would I share this with a friend?
BOTTOM LINE:
Long story ads work because they CREATE CONNECTION before they ask for action.

They make people FEEL understood.

They provide HOPE without hype.

And they lead naturally to a solution that feels EARNED, not sold.

Master this structure...

And you'll write ads that don't just get clicks...

They'll get BELIEVERS.

Additional Notes:
COPY CRITIQUES & LESSONS LEARNED
HOOK WRITING
Write the STORY first, THEN craft the hook - Don't force the hook and make the story fit it backwards
Punchy hooks with embellishments - Use quotes, dashes, ALL CAPS strategically
The hook doesn't need to cover the whole story - Just tease and bridge into the intro
Remove weak elements - If something doesn't emotionally land (like "windshield"), cut it
STORY STRUCTURE & FLOW
Events must flow naturally - Each event should logically lead to the next, not feel random or disconnected
Cause and effect matters - Show clear connections between events (parking ticket → realization → friend encounter → transformation)
Timeline needs to be realistic - Don't rush transformations or relationship changes
The parking ticket is the TRIGGER, not the star - It's a catalyst for realization, not the main focus
EMOTIONAL DEPTH
Stack the pain DEEP - Reveal the darkest, most vulnerable thoughts they won't say out loud
Use the phrase: "THAT'S why..." - Powerful realization moment that connects dots for the reader
Core wound focus - Tie everything to being SEEN, feeling INVISIBLE, losing relevance
Raw honesty - Write the shit they're thinking but won't admit to anyone
Show internal dialogue - "No wonder he doesn't touch me. No wonder he goes to bed before I do."
DIALOGUE & REALISM
Make conversations sound REAL - Not scripted or fake
Use natural reactions - "I almost dropped the pan" vs overly dramatic responses
Keep friend interactions believable - They give advice like actual friends, not sales pitches
Emotional beats matter - "My throat tightened" / "I almost started crying right there"
LANGUAGE & WORD CHOICE
Ban overused words: "tired," "radiant," "glow" (unless used strategically)
Use "BRIGHTER" instead of "glowing" - More specific and fresh
Vary emotional descriptions - Don't repeat the same feelings
Be specific with details - "Four months" hits harder than "a while"
PACING & READABILITY
Keep it TIGHT - Minimal scrolling, no fluff
One sentence paragraphs - Create rhythm and momentum
Break up complex thoughts - Use ellipses when beneficial
Short punchy sentences mixed with longer ones - Create natural flow
ENDINGS & CTAS
Tie endings to core wound - Show them being SEEN again, feeling ALIVE, getting confidence back
Clear benefit-rich CTA - Always show what they GET by clicking
End with hope and transformation - Not just product features
Use heart emoji (♥️) for warmth - Adds human touch
