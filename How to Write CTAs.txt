THE CTA (Call To Action)
Purpose: Bridge naturally from the story to the action. Make clicking feel like the obvious next step.

What Makes A Good CTA:
Flows seamlessly from the emotional story (not a jarring "BUY NOW")
Empathetic bridge — Acknowledges where THEY are emotionally
Benefit-rich — Tells them exactly what they'll GET by clicking
Low friction — Makes it sound simple, fast, affordable
Warm close — Ends with care and blessing
CTA Structure That Works:
1. Empathy/relatability line:

"If you're in the same boat I was, putting this off because it feels overwhelming or expensive or just too depressing to think about... I get it."
"If your kids are anything like mine, they'll pay for your funeral no matter what it costs them... Don't let them."
2. Urgency (without being pushy):

"But please, don't let your family end up like Sarah."
"If you've been working your whole life to leave your kids something... make sure they actually get it."
3. Clear action + benefit:

"I'm dropping the link below so you can see how to protect your family from funeral costs for as little as $1/day, the same way I finally did."
4. Warm close:

"God Bless ♥️"
Keys To Remember:
Don't just say "click here" — always attach a BENEFIT to the action
Keep it conversational — the CTA should sound like the rest of the copy
Make it about THEM — not about you or your product
End with warmth — "God Bless ♥️" feels caring, not salesy
