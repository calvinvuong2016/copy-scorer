ELEMENT #1: THE HOOK
Purpose: Stop the scroll. Make them CURIOUS enough to keep reading.

What Makes A Good Hook:
Pattern interrupt — It should break their expected scroll behavior
Specificity — Vague = boring. Specific = interesting.
Relatable pain or intrigue — They need to see themselves in it immediately
Short & punchy — Usually 1-2 sentences MAX
Hook Formulas That Work:
The "WTF Moment":

"My friend's daughter started a GoFundMe... for HIS funeral."
"My brother hasn't spoken to me in 4 years... because of Dad's funeral."
The "Unbelievable Consequence":

"My daughter skipped Disney... to pay off MY mother's funeral."
"I'm leaving my kids DEBT... not an inheritance."
The "Direct Address":

"If you're reading this, I'M DEAD."
Hook Enhancement Techniques:
1. Ellipses (...) for suspense:

Creates a pause that builds curiosity
"My friend's daughter started a GoFundMe... for HIS funeral."
2. ALL CAPS for emphasis:

Makes key words POP and creates emotional intensity
"I'm leaving my kids DEBT... not an inheritance."
"If you're reading this, I'M DEAD."
3. Parentheses for asides/clarification:

Adds a conversational "by the way" feel
"My daughter skipped Disney (the trip she'd been planning for months)... to pay off MY mother's funeral."
"I opened the letter from the funeral home ($12,000 due immediately)... and my hands started shaking."
4. Strategic capitalization (not just ALL CAPS):

Emphasize specific words to make them stand out
"My friend's daughter started a GoFundMe... for HIS funeral." (HIS emphasizes the shock)
"I'm leaving my kids DEBT... not an inheritance." (DEBT is the pattern interrupt)
Keys To Remember:
Lead with the MOST interesting part of your story
Don't bury the hook in setup or context
Use ellipses (...) to create suspense and rhythm
Use ALL CAPS or Strategic Caps to make important words POP
Use parentheses to add dimension or clarifying details
Make it FEEL like a real person talking, not a marketer
