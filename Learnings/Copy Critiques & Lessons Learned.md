# Copy Critiques & Lessons Learned

Ongoing feedback and corrections from copy reviews. Reference this before writing.

---

## Word Count & Density

- **Long Story ads should be 700-800 words MAX.** First drafts tend to run 1500+. Cut ruthlessly.
- If a line doesn't move the story forward, it doesn't belong. Every sentence earns its place or gets cut.
- When one section needs more room (like the transformation), trim OTHER sections instead of blowing past the word count.

---

## Transformation Section

- Don't rush the transformation. It's the PROOF the story works — give it real space.
- Include specific moments: mirror moments, less makeup needed, texture returning, someone else noticing, confidence building.
- Show both physical AND emotional wins — not just "my skin got better" but "I started saying yes to things again."

---

## Villain / Polarization

- When the story involves a comparison (sister, friend, coworker), make the other person the VILLAIN.
- **Stack reasons why they're the villain** — don't just show them being better, show them being subtly cruel about it.
- Polarization creates more emotion and drama, which people love. The reader needs someone to root AGAINST.
- The villain should be subtly cruel, not cartoonishly evil. Think: backhanded compliments, gatekeeping, soaking up attention, making little digs disguised as concern.
- The more you stack the villainy, the more satisfying the payoff when the narrator wins.

---

## Dialogue Realism

- **Nobody says "you look tired" in real life. Ever.** If a line of dialogue wouldn't come out of a real person's mouth, cut it.
- When in doubt, replace dialogue with an ACTION. Actions can be more devastating than words. (Example: filtering someone's face in a selfie says more than any quote.)
- Test every line of dialogue: "Would a real person actually say this out loud, in this exact situation?" If not, rewrite or replace with a moment.
- Real people don't give speeches. They say short, blunt things. Or they say nothing at all — and the silence hits harder.

---

## Mobile Formatting

- **No paragraph should exceed ~23 words / 3 lines on a mobile screen.** A paragraph can have more than one sentence, but it must stay under this limit.
- Break at natural breath points, not mid-thought. The split should feel like pacing, not chopping.
- This applies to ALL Facebook ad copy. Always write with mobile scroll in mind.

---

## Punctuation & Dashes

- **Do NOT use em dashes (--) in ad copy.** They feel unnatural and writerly. Real people don't think in em dashes.
- Use **commas** where the dash is acting as a parenthetical or aside (e.g., "this woman, bold as brass, walks right up").
- Use **ellipses (...)** where there's a pause, a beat, or a reveal (e.g., "products fail... it clicked").
- Ellipses and commas feel more conversational and match how women actually talk and type on Facebook.

## Sentence Flow & Connectivity

- **Every line must connect causally to the next.** No isolated facts dropped on the page. The reader should feel one thought pulling them into the next.
- Use connective tissue between lines: "so," "which meant," "and that's when," "because of that," "that's where I was when..."
- Test every transition: if a sentence could be deleted without the reader noticing the gap, it isn't connected. Rewrite until the causation is felt.
- The "I bought a new swimsuit" problem — a line that appears out of nowhere with no thread to what came before or after is a flow failure.

---

## Rhythm — No All-Staccato

- **Do NOT break every single sentence onto its own line.** When the entire ad is one-line-per-paragraph with zero variation, it sounds robotic and monotone.
- Real rhythm mixes: short punchy lines for emphasis AND slightly longer flowing sentences that carry the reader through a thought.
- Ask: does this paragraph need to be alone, or does it belong with the sentence before it? Sentences that are logically or emotionally connected should often share a paragraph.
- The chunk rule (~23 words max) and the staccato rule must both be satisfied at the same time.

---

## Narrator Voice — Relatable, Not Distant

- **Never describe emotions from above.** "What I felt was cold quiet terror" is a narrator observing a character. That's not relatable — it's distant.
- Put the reader INSIDE the moment. What was she actually thinking? What did she do? What did she say to herself?
- Use specific, embarrassing, real details that women recognize. Not "I felt invisible" — show what invisible actually looks like in her daily life.
- Internal monologue makes the narrator feel real. The reader should think "that's exactly what I would have thought."

---

## Transformation Payoff — Make It Exciting

- **Vague endings kill ads.** "The lights stayed on" or "he looked at me differently" is boring. The reader needs a real emotional climax to feel like the story paid off.
- Show the actual WIN — tears after, lost sleep, the husband who can't keep his hands off her, the moment she realized everything had changed.
- The payoff should feel earned and surprising. "I thought we'd find our way back slowly. We did not find our way back slowly." — that's a payoff.
- Physical AND emotional wins. Not just the body — the marriage, the confidence, the sex life, the photos she's back in.

---

## Ad Level — Drive the Click, Don't Sell

- **Never explain the mechanism at the ad level.** Ads don't sell — they drive the click. One vague bridge line is enough: "she found a real biological reason." Then move straight to transformation.
- Never include Erica's rebound story. It adds length and confusion. Just: she went from X to Y pounds because of one thing she found.
- The ad's only job is to create enough curiosity and emotion to get the click. Everything else happens on the lander and VSL.
