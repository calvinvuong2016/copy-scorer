AD 1 — "The Medicare Connection"

Headline:

If You're on Medicare, You Need to See This

Body:

Most seniors on Medicare have no idea there's a funeral discount connected to their eligibility.

I didn't either until about a week ago.

I'm not going to get into the details here because honestly, I didn't believe it until I saw the numbers for myself.

But I will say this -- if someone told me I could have my entire funeral paid for at THAT monthly rate, I would've laughed in their face.

I'm not laughing anymore.

Not every state offers it. And not everyone qualifies.

But if you're on Medicare, you owe it to yourself to at least check.

AD 2 — "The Bill Your Kids Can't Pay"

Headline:

The Average Funeral Now Costs Over $8,000

Body:

And if you haven't made a plan, guess who's paying for it?

Your kids. With money they don't have. During the worst week of their lives.

GoFundMe pages for funeral costs have gone up over 300% in the last few years.

That's real families begging strangers on the internet because mom or dad didn't have anything set up.

But here's what most people on Medicare don't know.

There's a discount on funeral coverage for seniors who qualify -- and the monthly cost is so low I had to read it twice.

I'm not going to put the number here because you won't believe me.

You have to see it for yourself.

AD 3 — "The Thing Funeral Homes Don't Mention"

Headline:

Funeral Homes Are Charging $12,000+ and Hoping You Don't See This

Body:

They've spent decades perfecting the guilt trip.

"Don't you want to honor your mother?"

And it works. Grieving families hand over credit cards for caskets that cost more than a month's rent because they're too emotional to say no.

Meanwhile, seniors on Medicare can get a discount on funeral coverage that the funeral industry would rather you didn't know about.

I can't say much about it here -- but the monthly cost is so low that it feels like it shouldn't be legal.

And no, I'm not exaggerating.

If you're on Medicare and you're in the right state, this could change everything for your family.

AD 4 — "The Aunt at Easter"

Headline:

My Aunt Told Me How Much She Pays for Funeral Coverage... I Made Her Say It Twice

Body:

She brought it up at Easter like it was nothing.

"Oh yeah, I've got my whole funeral taken care of."

I figured she meant she'd saved up a bunch of money or pre-paid at a funeral home or something.

Nope.

She said because she's on Medicare, she qualified for some kind of discount on funeral coverage, and when she told me the monthly cost I almost spit out my wine.

I kept asking what the catch was and she kept telling me there wasn't one.

Not everyone can get it though. Depends on your state and whether you're on Medicare.

But if you are... you need to see this.

AD 5 — "The Question Nobody Wants to Ask"

Headline:

Can Your Kids Afford to Bury You?

Body:

Rough question, I know.

But funerals are running $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 and climbing every single year.

And most families don't find out what it costs until they're sitting across from a funeral director with swollen eyes and a stack of paperwork.

That's not a position you want your kids in.

The wild part is there's a discount on funeral coverage right now for seniors on Medicare -- and the monthly cost is so low it honestly sounds fake when you first hear it.

But it's not fake. And it's not a scam.

If you're on Medicare, this is worth 30 seconds of your time.
