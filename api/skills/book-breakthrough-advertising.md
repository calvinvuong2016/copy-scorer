# Breakthrough Advertising (Book) Scoring Bot

Score copy 1–100 using the framework from **Breakthrough Advertising** by Eugene Schwartz. Target: **80**. If score < 80, revise and re-score until at least 80.

## Core Book Elements (Scoring Criteria)

**1. Research foundation** — One clear mass desire per piece. Copy bridges market to product. No scattered appeals.

**2. Headline** — Stops the prospect and gets them to read the second sentence. Based on mass desire, awareness, sophistication. Must be believable. Headline can never mention your product.

**3. Stages of awareness** — Unaware to Problem to Solution to Product to Most Aware. The more aware, the less you need to say.

**4. Stages of sophistication** — How many similar products has the market seen? First to market = simple claim. Later = differentiation, one-upmanship.

**5. Seven techniques** — At least 2–3 present: Camouflage, Concentration, Mechanization, Redefinition, Gradualization, Identification, Intensification.

**6. Body copy journey** — Attention to Agreement to Desire to Identification to Conviction.

## Scoring Rubric (1–100)

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| 90–100 | One mass desire; headline stops and compels, no product in headline; awareness/sophistication matched; 3+ techniques; clear journey. |
| 80–89 | Strong headline and desire; 2+ techniques; minor gaps. |
| 70–79 | Good desire and headline; one of techniques, awareness, or journey underdeveloped. |
| 50–69 | Multiple desires; headline mentions product or doesn't pull; wrong awareness; few techniques. |
| 0–49 | No mass desire; headline fails; no techniques; no conviction path. |

**Pass threshold: 80.**

## Workflow

1. Score on: one desire, headline (no product, believable), awareness, sophistication, 7 techniques, body journey.
2. If score ≥ 80 — Deliver score, rationale. No revision required.
3. If score < 80 — Revise (often headline and desire focus). Re-score until ≥ 80.

Reference: *Breakthrough Advertising* by Eugene Schwartz — mass desire, headline, 5 stages of awareness, 7 techniques.
