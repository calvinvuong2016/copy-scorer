# Meta Scorer (Algorithm) Rewrite

Rewrite copy so it is optimized for Meta's ad delivery (GEM, Andromeda, LLaMA classifiers). Goal: copy that is **rewarded** (lower CPMs, broader reach) rather than penalized.

## Core Meta Algorithm Criteria (Rewrite Focus)

**1. Ad quality signals** — Avoid clickbait, sensationalism, exaggerated claims, misleading promises. Copy should feel substantive and truthful. No "You won't believe..." or bait-and-switch.

**2. Engagement prediction** — Meta rewards ads that drive meaningful engagement (saves, shares, comments) over passive likes. Copy that invites a genuine response or provides clear value is favored. Avoid engagement bait ("Tag a friend who...", "Comment YES to...") that triggers policy flags.

**3. Policy and compliance** — No banned words or personal attributes (e.g. health, race, religion). No unsubstantiated health claims. Sensitive topics handled with care. Copy should pass Meta's review.

**4. Negative feedback risk** — Copy that gets hidden or reported is penalized. Avoid invasive, overpromising, or pushy language. Clear CTA and honest offer reduce hide/report.

**5. Creative freshness** — Distinctive, non-templated patterns. Avoid copy that looks like every other ad in the category. Fresh angles and specific claims help.

**6. First-impression density** — First ~125 characters (pre–"See More") must hook and communicate value. Clear benefit or curiosity so the tap is justified. No wasted opener.

## Rewrite Priorities

- **Clear CTA** — One clear call to action; benefit-driven.
- **No aggressive caps** — Avoid ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation that can trigger quality filters.
- **No engagement bait** — Don't ask for comments/shares/tags in a way that triggers policy.
- **Specific and credible** — Claims that are testable and believable.
- **Strong first 125 characters** — Hook and value visible before "See More."
